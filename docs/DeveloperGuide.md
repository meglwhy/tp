## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete id/H000001`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `SessionListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Household` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete id/H000001")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete id/H000001` Command" />

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteHouseholdCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.


How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `HouseholdBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteHouseholdCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteHouseholdCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a household).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="800" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the Em-Social data i.e., all `Household` objects and `Session` objects
* stores the currently 'selected' `Household` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Household>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both Em-Social data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `HouseholdBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedHouseholdBook`. It extends `HouseholdBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `HouseholdBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedHouseholdBook#commit()`- Saves the current household book state in its history.
* `VersionedHouseholdBook#undo()`- Restores the previous household book state from its history.
* `VersionedHouseholdBook#redo()`- Restores a previously household book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitHouseholdBook()`, `Model#undoHouseholdBook()` and `Model#redoHouseholdBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedHouseholdBook` will be initialized with the initial household book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single household book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete id/H000005` command to delete the 5th household in the household book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitHouseholdBook()`, causing the modified state of the household book after the `delete id/H000005` command executes to be saved in the `HouseholdBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted household book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David Family a/Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40 p/97751978` to add a new household. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitHouseholdBook()`, causing another modified household book state to be saved into the `HouseholdBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />


**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitHouseholdBook()`, so the household book state will not be saved into the `HouseholdBookStateList`.


Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoHouseholdBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous household book state, and restores the household book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial HouseholdBook state, then there are no previous HouseholdBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoHouseholdBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.


The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite - it calls `Model#redoHouseholdBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the household book to that state.

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `HouseholdBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest household book state, then there are no undone HouseholdBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoHouseholdBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.


Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the household book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitHouseholdBook()`, `Model#undoHouseholdBook()` or `Model#redoHouseholdBook()`. Thus, the `HouseholdBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitHouseholdBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `HouseholdBookStateList`, all household book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David Family a/Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40 p/97751978` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire household book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.


* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the household being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Simulating Missing/Corrupted Data Files in Em-Social

To simulate missing or corrupted data files and observe how Em-Social handles these situations, follow the steps below.
#### 1. Simulating Missing Files

To simulate the case where a data file is missing, simply delete the file before starting the application.

##### Example:
- **Missing `addressbook.log.0`, `config.json`, or `preferences.json` file:**
    - Delete the file from the directory.
    - **Expected Behavior:**
        - The application should handle the missing file gracefully, new logs will be created.

#### 2. Simulating Corrupted Files

To simulate file corruption, open any of the data files (e.g., `householdbook.json`, `addressbook.log.0`, `config.json`, or `preferences.json`) and modify their contents (e.g., change some characters, truncate the file, etc.).

##### Example:
- **Corrupted `addressbook.log.0` file:**
    - Open the file `addressbook.log.0` and introduce some random characters or truncate the file.
    - **Expected Behavior:**
        - The application will not be able to detect a corrupted log file but new logs will be appended without error.

- **Corrupted `config.json`, `preferences.json` file:**
    - Open the file and change some of its values to invalid data.
    - **Expected Behavior:**
        - The application will reset to the preferences when the user next starts up Em-Social.

- **Corrupted `householdbook.json` file:**
    - Open the file and change some of its values to invalid data.
    - **Expected Behavior:**
        - The application will reset to a fresh state when the user next starts up Em-Social.

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements

Team size: 4

1. Make the error messages for commands more specific as to wherein the problem lies. Some of the current error messages throw the required parameters and example command formats but is not specific enough.
2. Currently, the selected household above the sessions window does not automatically update as soon as the household's name is updated. We intend to make the selected household automatically update to reflect these real-time changes to reduce possible user-confusion.
3. Currently, the selected household above the sessions window is unable to display the full household name if it is too long. While the household panel displays the full name, we intend to fix this flaw in future for additional clarity for the user.
4. Corrupted `addressbook.log.0` file will detect the corrupted logs and **inform** the user about the corrupted logs.
